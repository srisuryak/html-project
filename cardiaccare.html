<h2>What is Cardiology?</h2>
<p>Cardiology is the discipline that researches, diagnoses and treats heart injuries and diseases as well as their causes. A cardiologist will treat your heart problem while staying aware of other conditions, including high blood pressure, high Cholesterol, diabetes and other factors that risk damaging the heart. Some of these risk factors include a family history of heart disease, obesity, cigarette smoking, poor diet and a sedentary lifestyle.</p>
<h2>Who is at Risk?</h2>
<p>Many people think that heart attacks are a “man’s problem,” yet heart disease is actually the number one killer of both men and women in the United States. In men, the risk for heart attack increases significantly after the age of 45. In women, heart attacks are more likely to occur in the years after menopause (usually, after the age of 50). However, younger men and women can also have heart attacks.</p>
<h2>Besides age, factors that increase the risk for heart attack are</h2>
<p>A previous heart attack or procedure to open up the coronary arteries
Family history of early heart disease
Father or brother diagnosed before age 55
Mother or sister diagnosed before age 65
Diabetes mellitus
High blood cholesterol
High blood pressure
Cigarette smoking
Overweight
Physical inactivity
If you have one or more of these factors, see your health care provider to find out how to reduce your risk of having a heart attack.

During a heart attack, a clot in the heart’s artery blocks the flow of blood to the heart. Heart muscle begins to die. This is technically called a “myocardial infarction,” meaning “death of heart muscle.” The more time that passes without treatment, the greater the damage. The part of the heart that dies during a heart attack cannot grow back or be repaired.

Fortunately, clot-busting drugs and other artery-opening treatments, such as angioplasty, can stop a heart attack in its tracks. Given soon after symptoms begin, these treatments can prevent or limit damage to the heart. The quicker they are started, the more good they will do and the greater the chances are of a full recovery. To be most effective, these treatments should be given within 1 hour of the start of heart attack symptoms. The benefit of opening the blocked artery decreases with each passing hour from symptom onset until treatment.</p>
